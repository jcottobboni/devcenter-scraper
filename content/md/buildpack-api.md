## Buildpack API

> callout
> We encourage buildpack developers to use `sh` or `bash` to ensure compatibility with future Heroku stacks.

A buildpack consists of three scripts:

* `bin/detect`: Determines whether to apply this buildpack to an app.
* `bin/compile`: Used to perform the transformation steps on the app.
* `bin/release`: Provides metadata back to the runtime.

### bin/detect

#### Usage

```
bin/detect BUILD_DIR
```

> callout
> The name sent to `stdout` will be displayed as the application type during push.


#### Summary

This script takes BUILD_DIR as a single argument and should return an exit code of `0` if the app present at `BUILD_DIR` can be serviced by this buildpack. If the exit code is `0`, the script should print a human-readable framework name to `stdout`.

#### Example

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# this pack is valid for apps with a hello.txt in the root
if [ -f $1/hello.txt ]; then
  echo "HelloFramework"
  exit 0
else
  exit 1
fi
```

### bin/compile

#### Usage

```
bin/compile BUILD_DIR CACHE_DIR
```

#### Summary

> callout
> The contents of `CACHE_DIR` will be persisted between builds. You can cache the results of long processes like dependency resolution here to speed up future builds.

This script performs the buildpack transformation. `BUILD_DIR` will be the location of the app and
`CACHE_DIR` will be a location the buildpack can use to cache build artifacts between builds.

All output received on `stdout` from this script will be displayed to the user.

The application in `BUILD_DIR` along with all changes made by the `compile` script will be packaged into a slug.

#### Style

Buildpack developers are encouraged to match the Heroku push style when displaying output.

```bash
-----> Main actions are prefixed with a 6-character arrow
       Additional information is indented to align
```

Whenever possible display the versions of the software being used.

```
-----> Installing dependencies with npm 1.0.27
```

#### Example

```bash
#!/bin/sh

indent() {
  sed -u 's/^/       /'
}

echo "-----> Found a hello.txt"

# if hello.txt has contents, display them (indented to align)
# otherwise error

if [ ! -s $1/hello.txt ]; then
  echo "hello.txt was empty"
  exit 1
else
  echo "hello.txt is not empty, here are the contents" | indent
  cat $1/hello.txt
fi | indent
```
    
### bin/release

#### Usage

```
bin/release BUILD_DIR
```

#### Summary

> callout
> `addons` will only be applied the first time an app is deployed.

`BUILD_DIR` will be the location of the app.

This script returns a YAML formatted hash with two keys:

* `addons` is a list of default addons to install.
* `default_process_types` is a hash of default `Procfile` entries.

This script will only be run if present. 

#### Example

```bash
#!/bin/sh

cat << EOF
---
addons:
  - heroku-postgresql:dev
default_process_types:
  web: bin/node server.js
EOF
```

Of course, rather than using `default_process_types`, it's simpler to just write a default Procfile if one isn't provided.

## Default config values 

To add default config values, create a [`.profile.d` script](/profiled). In most cases it's best to defer to an existing value if set.                                             

#### Example `.profile.d/nodejs.sh`

```bash
# default NODE_ENV to production
export NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:production}

# add node binaries to the path
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.node/bin
```

## Caching

> callout
> Use caution when storing large amounts of data in the `CACHE_DIR` as the full contents of this directory is stored with the git repo and must be network-transferred each time this app is deployed. A large `CACHE_DIR` can introduce significant delay to the build process.

The `bin/compile` script will be given a `CACHE_DIR` as its second argument which can be used to store artifacts between builds. Artifacts stored in this directory will be available in the `CACHE_DIR` during successive builds. `CACHE_DIR` is available only during slug compilation, and is specific to the app being built.

If the build pack does intend to use a cache, it should create the the CACHE_DIR directory if it doesn't exist.

Build packs often use this cache to store resolved dependencies to reduce build time on successive deploys.

## Binaries

A buildpack is responsible for building a complete working runtime environment around the app. This may necessitate including language VMs and other runtime dependencies that are needed by the app to run.

When building and packaging dependencies, make sure they are compatible with Heroku's runtime environment. One way to do that is to build dependencies in Heroku dynos, for example by using [`heroku run`](one-off-dynos).

## Publishing

Buildpacks may be published to the buildpack catalog service using the [heroku-buildpacks](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpacks) plugin.

## Example Buildpacks

The easiest way to get started creating a buildpack is to examine or fork one of the many existing buildpacks:
* [Default Buildpacks](buildpacks#default-buildpacks)
* [Third-party Buildpacks](third-party-buildpacks)
