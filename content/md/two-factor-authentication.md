Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your Heroku account by asking for a verification code after you sign in with your email address and password.

The verification code is generated by an application on your smartphone. To gain access to your account a potential attacker would need your email address, your password, as well as your phone.

We recommend all users enable two-factor authentication for their accounts.

>warning
>This article describes a [beta feature](heroku-beta-features). Functionality may change prior to general availability.

## Enabling two-factor authentication

> note
> Enabling two-factor authentication will log you out of all but the current session and re-generate your API key. Git push is not affected.

You can enable two-factor authentication on your [Dashboard account page][dashboard-account] by clicking the "Enable two-factor authentication” button and following the on-screen instructions.

Download an authenticator app for your smartphone. We recommend [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) or [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) but other alternatives work too.

>warning
>After enabling two-factor authentication, download and print your recovery codes and store them in a secure place. If you lose your phone, you can use them to authenticate. For security reasons, Heroku Support cannot restore access to accounts with two-factor authentication enabled if you lose your phone and don't have access to your recovery codes.

## Using two-factor on the command-line

Once your account has two-factor authentication enabled you will be asked to re-authenticate the next time you use the command-line interface.

> warning
> Make sure you have the latest CLI version with two-factor-auth support by running `heroku update`.

You can authenticate with your email address and password followed by the authentication code displayed on your phone:

```term
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: email@example.com
Password: password
Two-factor code: 123456
Authentication successful.
```

## Disabling two-factor authentication

We recommend keeping two-factor authentication enabled, however should you wish
to disable it temporarily you can do so on the [Dashboard account page][dashboard-account] or using the CLI.
