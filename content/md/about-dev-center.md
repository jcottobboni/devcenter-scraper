description: Dev Center hosts the most relevant content for developing applications on the Heroku platform.
---

Dev Center is part of an ongoing effort to bring the Heroku developer community the best, most relevant content possible – both for developing applications on the Heroku platform and for building applications in general.

Here's a little breakdown of how Dev Center is structured, how you can subscribe to updates, and contribute your own content.

## Finding content

Our library of articles has been growing rapidly, and you now have several ways in which you can find content and subscribe to new content.

### Categorization

* **Overview** is the new home for our [Getting Started series](/categories/getting-started), as well as information about the [basic components of the Heroku platform](/categories/platform-architecture).

* **Reference** is just that: a place for documenting APIs, commands, options, tools, and more. You'll find in-depth discussions of [platform features](/categories/platform-features), articles on the [heroku command line tool](/categories/command-line), [collaboration](/categories/collaboration), [deployment](/categories/deployment), and [troubleshooting your app](/categories/troubleshooting).

* **Tutorials** is where we expect to see the most growth. Currently, it houses information on building [Facebook](/categories/facebook) and [mobile](/categories/mobile) apps, and [adding specific functionality](/categories/features) to your app.

* **Languages** holds tutorials that are language specific, covering [Ruby](/categories/ruby), [Java](/categories/java), [Python](/categories/python), [Clojure](/categories/clojure), [Scala](/categories/scala) and [Node.js](/categories/nodejs).

* **Accounts & Billing** holds information about Heroku user account management, [billing policies and procedures](/categories/billing), and [support issues](/categories/support).

* **Add-ons** are a huge part of the Heroku platform, and in this category you'll find an [overview](/categories/addon-overview) of the program, as well as [documentation on the add-ons we offer](/categories/add-on-documentation).

### Search

In addition to reorganizing our articles, we've also been working on search. We monitor search carefully, looking at what's being searched for, and what search terms are coming up empty, tuning to ensure you're always getting the best results possible.

## Staying updated

The Dev Center is publishes new content every week.  Here are some of the ways in which you can subscribe:

* Visit the Dev Center [article listing](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles)
* Subscribe to the [article feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/herokudevcenterarticles)
* Subscribe to the article Twitter handle, [@herokudevcenter](https://twitter.com/herokudevcenter)

## Contributing

One of the biggest changes with Dev Center is that we're actively pursuing content from our partners and community. The [Facebook tutorial](facebook), for instance, was written by our friends at [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com) - and we've got other articles by top-notch authors in the works.

We've got a [list of open topics](/articles/open-topics) if you'd like something to start with.

## Heroku Changelog

The [Heroku Changelog](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog) is a chronological list of public-facing additions and changes to the Heroku platform. While we announce all major new features via the [Heroku blog](http://blog.heroku.com/), we're making small improvements all the time. 

When any changes or improvements have a user-visible impact, you'll find them in the changelog.

## Feedback

We're far from done! Look for ongoing changes to Dev Center in the future, including more ways for you to get involved – but in the meantime, you can take an active part by letting us know what you think – what have we missed?  What works particularly well? [We're listening](mailto:devcenter-feedback@heroku.com)!
