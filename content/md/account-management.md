Account management takes place in the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com).  Log on using your Heroku account to manage your applications and account.

## Changing your email address

You can change your email address on [your account page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account).

## Application limit

Unverified accounts can create a maximum of 5 apps. Add a credit card to verify your account. No more than 100 applications can be created on a single account.

## Account deletion

You may close your account by visiting [your account page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account). 
At the bottom of the page you will see a link to close your account.

If you have any unpaid balance, you may need to place a payment before you will be able to close the account. Older invoices can be taken care of from the [pay balance page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/pay-balance), while newer ones may have a future date on which they are scheduled to be charged.

> Please delete all apps on your account to make sure that no additional balance accrues while you are waiting for the final payment to be processed.
