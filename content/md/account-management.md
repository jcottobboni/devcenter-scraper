description: Managing your account and email details on Heroku.

Account management takes place in the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com).  Log on using your Heroku account to manage your applications and account.

## Changing your email address

You can change your email address on [your account page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account).

## Application limit

Unverified accounts can create a maximum of 5 apps. Add a credit card to verify your account. No more than 100 applications can be created on a single account.

## Account deletion

You may close your account by visiting [your account page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account). 
At the bottom of the page you will see a link to close your account.

Accounts cannot be closed if you have an open balance, so you may receive an **error message** if you have unpaid invoices. If those invoices are older, you may visit the [pay balance page](https://vault.heroku.com/pay-balance) to take care of them.

If the unpaid balance is for the current (or recently ended) month, you may have to wait for the billing cycle to complete and automatically charge your card. If you haven't already, be sure to **delete your apps** so that your balance does not continue to rise or create new invoices in the meantime.
