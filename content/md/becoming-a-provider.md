In order to effectively market your product to the Heroku community, you will need to be familiar with the basic Heroku user experience. If your team is new to the Heroku platform, we highly recommend you walk through the core concepts of creating and deploying an application on Heroku, to understand what sort of experience your future add-on customers will expect.

Once you've got that down, check out the article which covers [how your service will interact with the Heroku platform](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-addons-work).

After completing the tour, you should be ready to start the technical integration of your add-on service. To help guide you along there's both a step-by-step tutorial as well as several code examples. 

Finally, [you should download and review the business terms contained in the Add-on License Agreement](https://addons.heroku.com/provider/resources/HerokuAddonsLicenseAgreement.pdf).

## Building & Testing
One of the key goals for the Add-on Program is to make the process and experience of building add-ons as easy as possible. We've made sure that it's an open playground to experiment on - there is no registration or setup required to start building an add-on. In many cases a day or two is all that is needed to produce a working add-on. 

Help is also available primarily in [Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/extending-heroku) and also the [Add-on Provider mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/heroku-add-on-providers), for any questions about add-on development.

## Registering
Before you can load your add-on onto Heroku, and begin testing it with real users, [you must register on our Provider Portal](https://addons.heroku.com/provider/signup) as an Add-on Provider. All that's required to do this is a Heroku account. 

If you already have an existing account, you will log in with your existing credentials. If not, you will be able to sign-up for a new account. Upon sign-up/registration you will need to accept the terms of the Heroku Add-ons License Agreement. 

The purpose of this agreement is formally set up the business relationship between your company and Heroku. It covers the following:

* Distribution agreement granting Heroku permission to distribute your product via the Add-on Marketplace.
* Intellectual property protection for both parties.
* Revenue sharing terms, including payments, reporting and audits.
* Rules for pricing changes.
* Confidentiality, allowing your company and Heroku to safely share details about upcoming product features, usage metrics etc.
* Technical support and marketing responsibilities.

You can [download a copy of the agreement here](https://addons.heroku.com/provider/resources/HerokuAddonsLicenseAgreement.pdf). Be sure to familiarize yourself thoroughly with the terms and conditions before signing up.

Once registered you will have access to the Provider Portal, which gives you a single place to manage your Add-ons and your relationship with Heroku and offers instructions on how to submit your Add-ons to Heroku.
