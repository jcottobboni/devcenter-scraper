description: Ruby gems are managed on Heroku with Bundler.
---

Ruby gems can be installed on Heroku via [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) and an associated `Gemfile`.

Almost any gem - even those with native dependencies - can be installed using [Bundler](bundler). If there's a specific gem that won't install on Heroku, please [submit a support ticket](https://help.heroku.com/tickets/new).

See the [gem manifest](gemmanifest) page for full details on the *deprecated* `.gems` support.
