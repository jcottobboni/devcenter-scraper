<p>Accounts cannot be closed if you have an open balance, so you may receive an <strong>error message</strong> if you have unpaid invoices. If those invoices are older, you may visit the <a href="https://vault.heroku.com/pay-balance">pay balance page</a> to take care of them.</p>

<p>If the unpaid balance is for the current (or recently ended) month, you may have to wait for the billing cycle to complete and automatically charge your card. If you havenâ€™t already, be sure to <strong>delete your apps</strong> so that your balance does not continue to rise or create new invoices in the meantime.</p>
