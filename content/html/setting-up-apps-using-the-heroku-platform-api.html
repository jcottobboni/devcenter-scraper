<p>This article describes how to use the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#app-setup"><code>app-setups</code></a> resource of the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-quickstart">Platform API</a>. The resource, together with an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-json-schema"><code>app.json</code> manifest file</a> embedded in the source code, can be used to programmatically setup an app.</p>

<p>Here are some scenarios were <code>app.json</code> and <code>app-setups</code> might come in handy for source code that you maintain:</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to make it easy for collaborators to setup and deploy your source code to Heroku for testing in staging apps</li>
<li>You maintain a ready-to-deploy app or framework and you want to let others quickly deploy and try it out on Heroku</li>
</ul><p>The <code>app-setups</code> resource accepts a tar archive of an application’s source code, looks for the <code>app.json</code> manifest file, and uses it to orchestrate the first time setup of the application on Heroku, streamlining the deployment and release of the application.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-the-setup">Preparing for the setup</h2>

<p>Imagine that you want to deploy a simple application using the <code>app-setups</code> resource. This may be your own application or, a sample or template you are interested in.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/balansubr/ruby-rails-sample/">ruby-rails-sample</a> sample application is such an example. Note that this API applies to apps written in any language, and we’re just using Ruby here as an example.</p>

<p>The first step is to add an <code>app.json</code> configuration file to the app. This app’s configuration includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a config var in the runtime environment to customize the template</li>
<li>a couple of add-ons:

<ul>
<li>Papertrail for logging</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres for the database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a command to be run after deployment to prepare the database.</li>
</ul><p>To call the API, you need the URL of its source tarball.For this example, use <a href="https://github.com/balansubr/ruby-rails-sample/tarball/master/">this URL</a>. The API expects the <code>app.json</code> file, that contains this configuration information, to be present at the root of the source bundle’s directory structure.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>If you are using a public GitHub repo for your source code, GitHub provides a specific URL for each repo that resolves to a tarball of the repo’s contents. This URL typically looks like: <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;/tarball/master/</code></p>
</div>

<h2 id="creating-an-app-setup">Creating an app setup</h2>

<p>With a source tarball, which contains an <code>app.json</code>, call the <code>https://api.heroku.com/app-setups</code> endpoint to setup the <code>app.json</code> enabled application on Heroku. The request body must contain a source URL that points to the tarball of your application’s source code.</p>

<p>Let’s use cURL to call the <code>app-setups</code> endpoint:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ curl -n -X POST https://api.heroku.com/app-setups \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Accept:application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3" \
-d '{"source_blob": { "url":"https://github.com/balansubr/ruby-rails-sample/tarball/master/"} }'
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, the request can include an <code>overrides</code> section to provide values for environment variables specified in the <code>app.json</code>, override default values, or to provide additional environment variables. The only portion of the <code>app.json</code> that you can override is the <code>env</code> section.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ curl -n -X POST https://api.heroku.com/app-setups \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Accept:application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3" \
-d '{"source_blob": { "url":"https://github.com/balansubr/ruby-rails-sample/tarball/master/"},
"overrides": {"env": { "RAILS_ENV":"development", "SETUP_BY":"MyDeployerScript" } } }'
</code></pre>

<p>Heroku kicks off the setup of the application by creating the Heroku app with a generated app name, and immediately returns a response, which contains an ID that can be used in later requests:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "id": "df1c2983-fbde-455b-8e7b-e17c16bdf757",
    "failure_message": null,
    "status": "pending",
    "app": {
        "id": "888ee9fb-c090-499b-a115-2f335a1f0ef5",
        "name": "pacific-peak-6986"
    },
    "build": {
        "id": null,
        "status": null
    },
    "manifest_errors": [],
    "postdeploy": {
        "output": null,
        "exit_code": null
    },
    "resolved_success_url": null,
    "created_at": "2014-05-09T18:41:35+00:00",
    "updated_at": "2014-05-09T18:41:35+00:00"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes app creation may fail. If this happens, you get a failed response with some details about the failure, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{ "id": "invalid_params", "message": "You've reached the limit of 5 apps for unverified accounts. Add a credit card to verify your account." }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="polling-for-setup-status">Polling for setup status</h2>

<p>Using the ID, poll the API for status updates:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ curl -n https://api.heroku.com/app-setups/df1c2983-fbde-455b-8e7b-e17c16bdf757 \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Accept:application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3"
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the response when the build is kicked off:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{
  "id": "df1c2983-fbde-455b-8e7b-e17c16bdf757",
  "failure_message": null,
  "status": "pending",
  "app": {
    "id": "888ee9fb-c090-499b-a115-2f335a1f0ef5",
    "name": "pacific-peak-6986"
  },
  "build": {
    "id": "06503167-f75e-4ad6-bd06-4d5da3825eb5",
    "status": "pending"
   },
   "resolved_success_url": null,
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep polling until the status changes from <code>pending</code> to <code>succeeded</code> or <code>failed</code>.</p>

<p>If there are any issues during the setup, the response indicates those errors.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{
  "id": "df1c2983-fbde-455b-8e7b-e17c16bdf757",
  "failure_message": "app.json not found",
  "status": "failed",
  "app": {
    "id": "888ee9fb-c090-499b-a115-2f335a1f0ef5",
     "name": "pacific-peak-6986"
  },
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>At any point a step in the setup process fails, the app is deleted but the setup status is always available.</p>

<p>Once the build status has been updated to <code>succeeded</code> or <code>failed</code> you can use the build ID to call the Platform API for more detailed status of the build. See the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-and-release-using-the-api">Building and Releasing using the Platform API</a> for more information. To construct the build status request, you need both the name of the app being set up and the build ID; both of these are available in the response above.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ curl -n -X GET https://api.heroku.com/apps/pacific-peak-6986/builds/06503167-f75e-4ad6-bd06-4d5da3825eb5/result \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Accept:application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3"
</code></pre>

<p>This returns detailed build results which includes every line of the build output.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{
  "build": {
    "id": "06503167-f75e-4ad6-bd06-4d5da3825eb5",
    "status": "succeeded"
  },
  "exit_code": 0,
  "lines": [
    {
      "stream": "STDOUT",
      "line": "\n"
     },
     {
       "stream": "STDOUT",
       "line": "-----&gt; Ruby app detected\n"
     },
     ...
</code></pre>

<p>The output of the post deploy script is provided inline within the response to the polling request for the overall setup status.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">"postdeploy": {
  "output": "",
  "exit_code": 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the status is <code>succeeded</code>, the <code>resolved_success_url</code> is populated with a fully-qualified URL to which to redirect users upon completion of the setup. The value is derived from the <code>success_url</code> attribute in the <code>app.json</code> manifest file. If the <code>success_url</code> is absolute, it is returned as-is; if it relative, it is resolved in the context of the app’s <code>web_url</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">"resolved_success_url": "http://pacific-peak-6986.herokuapp.com/"
</code></pre>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>

<p>Here’s a look at what the Heroku Platform API does with different elements in the <code>app.json</code> file. Applications that have an <code>app.json</code> manifest file won’t behave any differently when deployed using the standard <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git">git based workflow</a>. The setup flow described in this article is only currently available through the API.</p>

<h3 id="application-metadata">Application metadata</h3>

<p>The <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>website</code>, <code>repository</code> and <code>logo</code> fields provide basic information about the application. This is simply for users looking at the <code>app.json</code> to understand what the application is about—the API does not use this section during application setup.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">"name": "Ruby on Rails",
"description": "A template for getting started with the popular Ruby framework.",
"website": "http://rubyonrails.org"
</code></pre>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h3>

<p>The <code>env</code> section consists of a series of variables with more information about them. For each variable, the API sets up a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars">config var</a> on the app.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">"env": {
  "RAILS_ENV": "production",
  "COOKIE_SECRET": {
    "description": "This gets generated",
    "generator": "secret"
  },
  "SETUP_BY": {
    "description": "Who initiated this setup",
    "required": true
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A variable can have a description and a default value. As shown in a previous example, the Platform API request may include a <code>overrides</code> section that provides values to override these defaults.</p>

<p>If a value is provided in the <code>app.json</code>, the API treats it as a required variable. Otherwise, values for variables marked as required must be provided in the <code>overrides</code> section when the Platform API is called or the setup will fail.</p>

<p>Some variables need values that are generated when the application is deployed and set up. You may specify a generator for these variables. The only generator supported today is <code>secret</code> which generates a 64 character hexadecimal string.</p>

<p>This section may also contain a <code>BUILDPACK_URL</code> to specify which buildpack should be used to build the application’s slug.</p>

<h3 id="add-ons">Add-ons</h3>

<pre><code class="javascript">"addons": ["heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev", "papertrail"]
</code></pre>

<p>The API provisions add-ons immediately after creating the app, before the code is built and released. The <code>app.json</code> may specify just the add-on name or the add-on name together with a specific tier. When no tier is specified, the Platform API provisions the lowest tier, which for many add-ons is its free tier.</p>

<h3 id="post-deployment-scripts">Post-deployment scripts</h3>

<p>You can specify one postdeploy script in the <code>app.json</code> file. This script will be executed by Heroku on a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos">one-off dyno</a> as soon as your application has been built and released. The script is run in the same environment as your application and has access to its config vars and add-ons.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">"scripts": {
  "postdeploy": "bundle exec rake db:migrate"
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have multiple commands to execute, put them in a script, add the script to the source bundle and provide the command you would use to run that script as the value for <code>postdeploy</code>. You can also write your scripts in the same language as your application and provide the appropriate command such as <code>rails setup-script.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-deployed-app">The deployed app</h2>

<p>The Heroku app in this example has been setup with the following config vars:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku config -a pacific-peak-6986
