<p>Rake tasks are executed as <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos">one-off dynos</a> on Heroku, using the same environment as your app’s <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos">dynos</a>. You can run Rake tasks within the remote app environment using the <code>heroku run rake</code> command as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku run rake db:version
Running `rake db:version` attached to terminal... up, run.1
(in /home/slugs/41913_06f36ef_ab3a/mnt)
Current version: 20081118092504
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass Rake arguments, run multiple tasks, and pass environment variables
just as you would locally. For instance, to migrate the database to a specific
version with verbose backtraces:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku run rake --trace db:migrate VERSION=20081118092504
</code></pre>

<p>After running a migration you’ll want to restart your app with <code>heroku restart</code> to reload the schema and pickup any schema changes.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>Not all Rake features are supported on Heroku. The following is
a list of known limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rake tasks that write to disk, such as <code>rake db:schema:dump</code>, are not
compatible with Heroku’s ephemeral filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>db:reset</code> task is not supported. Heroku apps do not have permission to drop and create databases. Use the <code>heroku pg:reset</code> command instead.</p></li>
</ul>
