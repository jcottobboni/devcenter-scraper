<p>Whenever you <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git">deploy code</a>, change a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars">config var</a>, or add or remove an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/managing-add-ons">add-on resource</a>, Heroku creates a new release and restarts your app. You can list the history of releases, and use rollbacks to revert to prior releases for backing out of bad deploys or config changes.</p>

<h2 id="release-creation">Release creation</h2>

<p>Release are named in the format <code>vNN</code>, where <code>NN</code> is an incrementing sequence number for each release.</p>

<p>Releases are created whenever you deploy code. In this example, v10 is the release created by the deploy:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git push heroku master
...
-----&gt; Compiled slug size is 8.3MB
-----&gt; Launching... done, v10
       http://severe-mountain-793.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku</code></pre>

<p>Release are created whenever you change config vars. In this example, v11 is the release created by the config change:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku config:set MYVAR=42
Adding config vars:
  MYVAR =&gt; 42
Updating vars and restarting app... done, v11</code></pre>

<p>And releases are created whenever you add, remove, upgrade, or downgrade add-on resources. In this example, v12 is the release created by the add-on change:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku addons:add memcache
Adding memcache to myapp... done, v12 (free)</code></pre>

<h2 id="listing-release-history">Listing release history</h2>

<p>To see the history of releases for an app:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku releases
Rel   Change                          By                    When</code></pre>
<hr><pre><code>v52   Config add AWS_S3_KEY           jim@example.com       5 minutes ago
v51   Deploy de63889                  stephan@example.com   7 minutes ago
v50   Deploy 7c35f77                  stephan@example.com   3 hours ago
v49   Rollback to v46                 joe@example.com       2010-09-12 15:32:17 -0700</code></pre>

<p>The number next to the deploy message, for example de63889, corresponds to the commit hash of the repository you deployed to Heroku. Use this to correlate changes in a release with a changes in your code repository. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git log -n 1 de63889
commit de63889c20a96347679af2c5160c390727fa6749
Author: &lt;stephan@example.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Jul 11 17:16:20 2013 +0200
Fixed listing CSS and localisation of description.</code></pre>

<p>To get detailed info on a release:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku releases:info v24
=== Release v24
Change:      Deploy 575bfa8
By:          jim@example.com
When:        6 hours ago
Addons:      deployhooks:email, releases:advanced
Config:      MY_CONFIG_VAR =&gt; 42
             RACK_ENV      =&gt; production</code></pre>

<h2 id="rollback">Rollback</h2>
<div class="callout">

<p>You cannot roll back to a release which would change the state of add-ons, since this affects billing.</p>

</div>
<p>Use the <code>rollback</code> command to roll back to the last release:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku rollback
Rolled back to v51</code></pre>

<p>You may choose to specify another release to target:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku rollback v40
Rolled back to v40</code></pre>

<p>Rolling back will create a new release which is a copy of the state of the compiled slug and config vars of the release specified in the command. The state of your <code>heroku</code> Git remote, database, and external state held in add-ons (for example, the contents of memcache) will <strong>not</strong> be affected and is your responsibility to reconcile with the rollback.</p>

<p>Running on a rolled-back release is meant as a <strong>temporary fix</strong> to a bad deployment. If you are on a rolled-back release, fix and commit the problem locally, and re-push to Heroku to update the <code>heroku</code> Git remote and create a new release.</p>
