<p>Older Heroku accounts may be asked to confirm that you agree to be billed before performing your first paid action such as adding a paid add-on or scaling your appâ€™s dynos.</p>

<p>From the command line, you will see:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:crane
Adding heroku-postgresql:crane to sushi... 
This action will cause your account to be billed at the end of the month
Are you sure you want to do this? (y/n)</code></pre>

<p>and from the web UI, you will see a checkbox or a popup to confirm billing.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also use the heroku command line tool to confirm your account:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku account:confirm_billing</code></pre>
