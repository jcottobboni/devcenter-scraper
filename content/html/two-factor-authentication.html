<p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your Heroku account by asking for a verification code after you sign in with your email address and password.</p>

<p>The verification code is generated by an application on your smartphone. To gain access to your account a potential attacker would need your email address, your password, as well as your phone.</p>

<p>We recommend all users enable two-factor authentication for their accounts.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Enabling two-factor authentication will log you out of all but the current session and re-generate your API key. Git push is not affected.</p>
</div>

<p>You can enable two-factor authentication on your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/account">Dashboard account page</a> by clicking the “Enable two-factor authentication” button and following the on-screen instructions.</p>

<p>Download an authenticator app for your smartphone. We recommend <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://www.authy.com/">Authy</a> but other alternatives work too.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>After enabling two-factor authentication, download and print your recovery codes and store them in a secure place. If you lose your phone, you can use them to authenticate. For security reasons, Heroku Support cannot restore access to accounts with two-factor authentication enabled if you lose your phone and don’t have access to your recovery codes.</p>

<h2 id="using-two-factor-on-the-command-line">Using two-factor on the command-line</h2>

<p>Once your account has two-factor authentication enabled you will be asked to re-authenticate the next time you use the command-line interface.</p>

<div class="warning">
