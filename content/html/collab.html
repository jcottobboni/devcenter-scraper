<p>Heroku makes it easy to collaborate with others. Collaborating allows you to share access to your source code, make any changes and deploy a new version of the application quickly and easily.</p>

<p>You can <a href="/articles/sharing">start sharing</a> existing applications with a single command.</p>

<p>This articles shows how new collaborators can get started.</p>

<p>Install the <a href="https://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/">Heroku Toolbelt</a> on your local workstation. This ensures that you have access to the <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line">Heroku command-line client</a> and the Git revision control system.</p>

<h3 id="clone-the-code">Clone the code</h3>

<p>Next you should clone the app locally. The invitation email included the name of the app. You can use <code>heroku git:clone --app theirapp</code> for this, but it’s recommended that you get access to their canonical repository (for instance on GitHub) and then use <code>heroku git:remote</code> to add a git remote to your checkout.</p>

<h3 id="edit-and-deploy">Edit and deploy</h3>

<p>First ensure that your keys are already on Heroku. If you haven’t already uploaded them, run:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku keys:add</code></pre>

<p>You can now make your changes. When you are ready to deploy these changes, simply commit and push your changes:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git commit -a -m "Description of the changes I made"
$ git push heroku master
-----&gt; Heroku receiving push
-----&gt; Launching.... done</code></pre>
