<p>So you’ve made a plan or two, but they <em>just</em> aren’t quite right. Here’s how to reprice or edit your plan.</p>

<p>For pricing advice, read <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/add-on-plan-creation#pricing-plans">Add-on Plan Creation</a>.</p>

<p>Providers can create Add-on plans in the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/provider/dashboard">Provider Portal</a></p>

<p>If you are raising the price of an add-on, you need to make a decision about your existing users. You have two choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grandfather in the existing plan users at the price they currently pay.</li>
<li>Raise prices for existing plan users with 30 days notice.</li>
</ul><p>Either way, we will charge new users at the new price when we are notified.</p>

<p>When you are ready, please send an email to provider@heroku.com with the plan name, the new price, and your choice of grandfathering or giving notice to existing users.</p>

<p>Email us at provider@heroku.com with the plan name and the new price. We’ll get it done as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Say you want to change all your plan names or add/delete multiple features from a plan, what should you do? If you are making drastic plan changes, it is actually easier to create a new plan and migrate users to the new plan. Please make your new plan in the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/provider/dashboard">Provider Portal</a>.</p>

<p>To add a single feature or make other small changes, email us the plan name and the details of the change at provider@heroku.com.</p>
