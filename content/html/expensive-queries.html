<p>Expensive queries are the most significant cause of performance issues
on Heroku Postgres databases. Optimizing expensive queries can yield tremendous improvements to you application’s performance and overall response times.</p>

<p>Heroku Postgres monitors trending information for queries on a database, tracking the queries executed per minute, average time, and total IO time.</p>

<div class="callout">
<p>Expensive Queries functionality is supported on Heroku Postgres database versions greater than 9.2. It is also not supported on the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-plans#plan-tiers">Hobby tier</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>To view the expensive queries for your database, navigate to your <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/databases">database list</a> and scroll down to the “Expensive Queries” section. A graph of the trending information for a query can be viewed by clicking on the query. The timezone on the graph is your local browser time. One week of performance information is stored.</p>

<h2 id="causes-of-expensive-queries">Causes of Expensive Queries</h2>

<p>The most common causes of expensive queries are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of indexes, causing slow lookups on large tables,</li>
<li>Unused indexes, causing slow <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> operations,</li>
<li>Inefficient schema leading to bad queries</li>
<li>Queries with inefficient designs</li>
<li>Large databases size or lock contention, causing slow <code>COPY</code> operations (usually used for <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#logical-backups-on-heroku-postgres">logical backups</a>).</li>
</ul><h2 id="solutions-to-expensive-queries">Solutions to Expensive Queries</h2>

<p>These are some guidelines that may help fixing expensive queries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> (though <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#pg-psql">pg:psql</a>) to find out what is taking up most of the execution time of the query. A sequential scan on a large table is typically, but not always, a bad sign. Efficient indexes can improve query performance dramatically. Consider <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/postgresql-indexes">all Postgres techniques</a> such as partial indexes and
others when devising your index strategy.</li>
<li>Look for unused indexes by running <code>heroku pg:diagnose</code>. Drop any that are not required.</li>
<li>Upgrade your database to the latest version: Postgres performance is known to improve on every release.</li>
<li>For large database, prefer relying on our <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#physical-backups-on-heroku-postgres">continuous protection</a> for day to day disaster recovery purposes. Remove any auto <code>pgbackups</code> plans and use pgbackups strictly for <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#logical-backups-on-heroku-postgres">extracting or migrating data</a>.</li>
<li>For smaller database, slow logical backups can be a result of lock contention.</li>
</ul>
