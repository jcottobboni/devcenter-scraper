<p>The Dev Center is a widely-referenced source for both Heroku platform as well as modern web application development documentation. External contributions for topics central to architecting and developing robust applications on Heroku are encouraged.</p>
<div class="note">

<p>If you're interested in contributing a topic not listed below, please <a href="mailto:devcenter-feedback@heroku.com?subject=Contribution%20interest:%20Custom%20topic">let us know</a>. Well-written articles addressing the tenets of modern web application development are welcome, especially when based on your experiences deploying to Heroku.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-application-servers">Ruby application servers</h2>

<p>There are many app servers available for Ruby applications including Thin, Unicorn etc… Create an article that details the pros and cons of each in an unbiased fashion and in a context specific to Heroku and demonstrates proper configuration of each.</p>

</ul><h2 id="uploading-files-to-s3">Uploading files to S3</h2>

<p><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3">Uploading files to S3</a> (or some other persistent file storage) is a necessity given the ephemeral nature of truly elastic applications. Several articles are needed to extend the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3">existing article</a> and clearly demonstrate this process using both the direct and pass-through upload methods.</p>

<ul>

</ul><h2 id="background-jobs-and-queueing">Background jobs and queueing</h2>

<p><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/background-jobs-queueing">Background jobs and queueing</a> is an established pattern for deferring long-running work – moving it from the user’s request/response lifecycle to a seperate out-of-process worker. Language/framework specific articles are needed to extend the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/background-jobs-queueing">existing article</a> and clearly demonstrate the implementation of this pattern on Heroku.</p>

</ul><h2 id="scheduled-jobs-and-custom-clock-processes">Scheduled jobs and custom clock processes</h2>

<p><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduled-jobs-custom-clock-processes">Custom clock processes</a> are specialized process types that manage the execution schedule of time and interval-based work. Language/framework specific articles are needed to extend the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduled-jobs-custom-clock-processes">existing article</a> and clearly demonstrate the implementation of this pattern on Heroku.</p>

<p>Properly implementing <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/increasing-application-performance-with-http-cache-headers">HTTP Cache Headers</a> is a fundamental aspect of developing responsive web apps. Several articles are needed to extend the existing article and demonstrate appropriate http caching strategies in each primary language and framework.</p>

<p>Contributing an article to the Dev Center is a rewarding experience that puts the author’s ideas and work in front of a large and diverse group of technologists. New articles are broadcast via the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/herokudevcenter">@HerokuDevCenter</a> Twitter account and the monthly Heroku newsletter.</p>

<p>All externally contributed articles are attributed in a way that highlights both the author and their organization.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.heroku.com/devcenter/contribution-guide/attribution-header.png" alt="Attributed article banner"></p>

<p>The Heroku Dev Center is the resource for Heroku’s massive developer audience across the most popular languages and frameworks. High-quality articles often become the canonical resource for their subject matter due to the wide reach and social nature of the Heroku community.</p>

<p>Authors retain full visibility and ownership of their articles after publishing. Regular automated updates are sent detailing the reach and popularity of their articles along with realtime user feedback.</p>

## Notes

* How represent parent-child relationship
* How represent predicate articles (HTTP Cache Headers b/f Cloudfront)
* Need to flesh out article outline better, TOC etc...
* When set expectations (ref apps, ownership, feedback)
* Add contribute links in high-level parent articles
