<p>Git is a powerful decentralized revision control system, and is the
means for deploying apps to Heroku. You don’t need to be proficient with Git to
use it for deploying code to Heroku, but you may find it valuable to learn the
basics.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-your-app-in-git">Tracking your app in git</h2>

<div class="callout">
<p>Heroku apps expect the app directory structure at the root of the repository.  If your app is inside a subdirectory in your repository, it won’t run when pushed to Heroku.</p>
</div>

<p>Before you can push an app to Heroku, you’ll need to initialize a local Git repo
and commit your files to it.  For example, if you have an app in a directory, myapp, then create a new repo for it:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ cd myapp
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "my first commit"
Created initial commit 5df2d09: my first commit
 44 files changed, 8393 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 README
 create mode 100644 Procfile
 create mode 100644 app/controllers/source_file
...
</code></pre>

<p>This is a local repository, now residing inside the <code>.git</code> directory.  Nothing has
been sent anywhere yet; you’ll need to create a remote and do a push to deploy
your code to Heroku.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-heroku-remote">Creating a Heroku remote</h2>

<p><a href="http://progit.org/book/ch2-5.html">Git remotes</a> are references to remote repositories.  You can have any number of
these, but for now we’ll focus on just the remote to Heroku.  The <code>heroku create</code> command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a git remote that must be used to receive your application source.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku create
Creating falling-wind-1624... done, stack is cedar
http://falling-wind-1624.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:falling-wind-1624.git
Git remote heroku added
</code></pre>

<p>Heroku’s git remotes use SSH as a transport, so you’ll need to make sure your SSH public key <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys">has been added to your Heroku account</a>.</p>

<p>You can verify the remote in your git configuration as well:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git remote -v
heroku     git@heroku.com:falling-wind-1624.git (fetch)
heroku     git@heroku.com:falling-wind-1624.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also take an existing Git repo and add a remote using the git URL provided
when you created your app.  You may need to do this to associate a Git repo with an existing application.  The <code>heroku git:remote</code> command will add this remote for you based on your applications git url.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku git:remote -a falling-wind-1624
Git remote heroku added.
</code></pre>

<p>The remote is named <code>heroku</code> in this example, but you can name the remote
anything you want by passing <code>-r other_remote_name</code>.  You may find it easier to follow the examples if you stick to using the <code>heroku</code> remote rather than using one with a different name.</p>

<p>There is one special remote name: <code>origin</code>, which is the default for pushes.
Using origin as the remote name will allow you to type just <code>git push</code> instead
of <code>git push heroku</code>, but we recommend using an explicitly named remote.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-code">Deploying code</h2>

<p>Your Heroku app starts with a blank repository – it has no branches and no
code. So the first time you deploy, you’ll need to specify a remote branch to
push to. You can do your first push:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git push heroku master
updating 'refs/heads/master'
...
</code></pre>

<p>This will push your code to the <code>heroku</code> remote, created earlier. Use this whenever you want to deploy the latest code committed in Git to Heroku.</p>

<p>Branches pushed to Heroku other than <code>master</code> will be ignored by this command.  If you’re
working out of another branch locally, you can either merge to master before
pushing, or specify that you want to push your local branch to a remote master.
To push a branch other than master, use this syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git push heroku yourbranch:master
</code></pre>

<div class="note">
<p>Applications that rely on git submodules are supported, in addition to many other <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git-submodules">dependency resolution strategies</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="cancelling-a-deployment">Cancelling a deployment</h2>

<p>When deploying code using <code>git push</code>, you can interrupt the build process on Heroku by pressing Ctrl + C on your machine.  As long as this is not done as the build process completes (generally around the “Launching…” message), and you’ve taken latency into account, then it will halt the build process and no new release will be generated.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-remotes-and-environments">Multiple remotes and environments</h2>

<p>The same techniques used to deploy to production can be used to deploy a development branch of your application to a staging application on Heroku, as described in <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/multiple-environments">Managing Multiple Environments for an App</a>.</p>

<h2 id="repo-size">Repo size</h2>

<p>While there is not a hard limit on your repository size, very large
repositories (over 600MB) are not recommended; they may cause timeouts
and slow pushes overall. Running <code>heroku apps:info</code> will show you your
repository size. Your build cache is stored inside your repository, so
don’t be surprised if it’s larger remotely than locally.</p>

<p>Common causes of large repositories are binary files checked into the
repo (git is notoriously bad at handling binaries) or
constantly-changing development logs. Removing files committed by
accident can be done with
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Maintenance-and-Data-Recovery#Removing-Objects">git filter-branch</a>,
though after running it you will have to push with the <code>--force</code>
option, which is something that requires coordination among your team.</p>

<h2 id="other-limits">Other limits</h2>

<p>To protect the Git service, users are limited to a rolling window of 75 Git requests per hour, per SSH key. Once this limit is reached, Git requests are denied until request levels dropped below the limit for a few minutes, with the error message:</p>

<pre><code> !  Too many requests for this Git repo. Please try again later.
</code></pre>

<p>If you reach this limit, ensure there are not automated processes or scripts polling the Git repo.</p>

<h2 id="using-subversion-or-other-revision-control-systems">Using subversion or other revision control systems</h2>

<p>What if you’re already using Subversion or another revision control system to
track your source code? Although we believe that Git is one of the best choices
available for revision control, you don’t need to stop using your current
revision control system. Git can be purely a deployment mechanism, existing
side-by-side with your other tool.</p>

<div class="callout">
<p>You can learn much more about <code>.gitignore</code> in <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/gitignore">our article on the topic</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, if you are using Subversion, initialize your Git repo as described above. Then, add a <code>.gitignore</code> file to tell Git to ignore your Subversion directories.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git init
$ echo .svn &gt; .gitignore
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "using git for heroku deployment"
</code></pre>

<p>Now tell Subversion to ignore Git:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ svn propset svn:ignore .git .
property 'svn:ignore' set on '.'
$ svn commit -m "ignoring git folder (git is used for heroku deployment)"
</code></pre>

<div class="callout">
<p>The <code>-f</code> (force flag) is recommended in order to avoid conflicts with other developers' pushes. Since you are not using Git for your revision control, but as a transport only, using the force flag is a reasonable practice.</p>
</div>

<p>Each time you wish to deploy to Heroku:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "commit for deploy to heroku"
...

$ git push -f heroku
</code></pre>
