<p>In order to ensure you are pushing your code to Heroku you can verify your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_fingerprint">SSH fingerprint</a> of our Git endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="manually-verifying">Manually verifying</h2>

<p>The current Heroku SSH Git fingerprint is <code>8b:48:5e:67:0e:c9:16:47:32:f2:87:0c:1f:c8:60:ad</code>.</p>

<p>When you first <code>git push heroku master</code>, please manually match the provided SSH key to this fingerprint.</p>

<p>Should we need to change our SSH key in the future we will keep this page updated with the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="verifying-with-dns">Verifying with DNS</h2>

<p>You can make use of our <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4255.txt">SSHFP DNS</a> records by adding the following lines to your ~/.ssh/config</p>

<pre><code>Host heroku.com
 VerifyHostKeyDNS yes</code></pre>

<p>Because DNSSEC is not fully implemented yet our SSHFP records are not trusted so you will be prompted to acknowledge the fingerprint the first time you connect:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git push heroku master
&gt; The authenticity of host 'heroku.com (50.19.85.132)' can't be established.
&gt; RSA key fingerprint is 8b:48:5e:67:0e:c9:16:47:32:f2:87:0c:1f:c8:60:ad.
&gt; Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
&gt; Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</code></pre>

<p>Ensure that the <code>matching host key fingerprint</code> is found before continuing.</p>

<p>On subsequent requests you will not be prompted to confirm the fingerprint.</p>

<p>Please note that adding <code>VerifyHostKeyDNS yes</code> will add a slight amount of overhead to each Git operation as the SSHFP record will be consulted each time.</p>
