<p><a href="/articles/heroku-postgresql">Heroku Postgres</a> offers a wide spectrum of plans appropriate for everything from personal blogs all the way to large-dataset and high-transaction applications. Choosing the right plan depends on the unique usage characteristics of your app as well as your organization’s availability and uptime expectations.</p>

<h2 id="plan-tiers">Plan tiers</h2>

<p><a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/pricing">Heroku Postgres’s many plans</a> are segmented in two broad tiers: Starter and production. Each tier then contains several individual plans. While these two tiers share many features there are several differences that will determine what database plan is most appropriate for your use-case.</p>

<h3 id="shared-features">Shared features</h3>

<p>The starter and production tier database plans all share the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fully managed database service with automatic health checks</li>

<li>Write-ahead log (WAL) off-premise storage every 60 seconds, ensuring minimal data loss in case of catastrophic failure</li>

<li>
<a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/1/31/simple_data_sharing_with_data_clips/">Data clips</a> for easy and secure sharing of data and queries</li>

<li>SSL-protected psql/libpq access</li>

<li>Running unmodified Postgres v9.1 or v9.2 (v9.0 is available on production tier only) for guaranteed compatibility</li>

<li>Postgres <a href="/articles/heroku-postgres-extensions-postgis-full-text-search">extensions</a>
</li>

<li>A full-featured <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/databases">web UI</a>
</li>
</ul><h3 id="starter-tier">Starter tier</h3>
<p class="warning">The starter tier database plans are not intended for production-caliber applications or applications with high-uptime requirements.</p>
<p>The starter tier, which includes the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql"><code>dev</code> and <code>basic</code> plans</a>, has the following limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enforced row limits of 10,000 rows for <code>dev</code> and 10,000,000 for <code>basic</code> plans</li>

<li>Max of 20 connections</li>

<li>No in-memory cache: The lack of an in-memory cache limits the performance capabilities since the data can’t be accessed on low-latency storage.</li>

<li>No <a href="/articles/heroku-postgres-follower-databases">fork/follow</a> support: Fork and follow, used to create replica databases and master-slave setups, are not supported.</li>

<li>Expected uptime of 99.5% each month</li>

<li>No postgres logs</li>
</ul><h3 id="row-limit-enforcement">Row limit enforcement</h3>

<p>When you are over the starter tier row limits and try to insert you will see a Postgres error:</p>

<pre><code>permission denied for relation &lt;table name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The row limits of the starter tier database plans are enforced with the following mechanism:</p>

<ol>
<li>When a <code>dev</code> database hits 7,000 rows, or a <code>basic</code> database hits 1 million rows , the owner receives a warning e-mail stating they are nearing their row limits.</li>

<li>When the database exceeds its row capacity, the owner will receive an additional notification. At this point, the database will receive a 24-hour grace period to either reduce the number of records, or <a href="/articles/heroku-postgres-follower-databases#database-upgrades-and-migrations-with-changeovers">migrate to another plan</a>.</li>

<li>If the number of rows still exceeds the plan capacity after 24 hours, <code>INSERT</code> privileges will be revoked on the database. Data can still be read, updated or deleted from database. This ensures that users still have the ability to bring their database into compliance, and retain access to their data.</li>

<li>Once the number of rows is again in compliance with the plan limit, <code>INSERT</code> privileges are automatically restored to the database. Note that the database sizes are checked asynchronously, so it may take a few minutes for the privileges to be restored.</li>
</ol><h3 id="production-tier">Production tier</h3>

<p>As the name implies, the production tier of Heroku Postgres is intended for production applications and includes the following feature additions to the starter tier:</p>

<ul>
<li>No row limitations</li>

<li>Increasing amounts of in-memory cache</li>

<li>
<a href="/articles/heroku-postgres-follower-databases">Fork and follow</a> support</li>

<li>Max of 500 connections</li>

<li>1 TB of storage</li>

<li>Expected uptime of 99.95% each month</li>

<li>
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-metrics-logs">Database metrics published</a> to application log stream for further analysis</li>
</ul><p>Management of production tier database plans is also much more robust including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eligible for automatic daily snapshots with 1-month retention (see the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups">PGBackups add-on</a> for more details)</li>

<li>Priority service restoration on disruptions</li>
</ul><h2 id="production-plans">Production plans</h2>

<p>Non-production applications, or applications with minimal data storage, performance or availability requirements can choose between one of the two starter tier plans, <code>dev</code> and <code>basic</code>, depending on row requirements. However, production applications, or apps that require the features of a production tier database plan, have a variety of plans to choose from. These plans vary primarily by the size of their in-memory data cache.</p>

<h3 id="cache-size">Cache size</h3>

<p>Each <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/pricing">production tier plan’s</a> RAM size constitutes the total amount of System Memory on the underlying instance’s hardware, most of which is given to Postgres and used for caching.. While a small amount of RAM is used for managing each connection and other tasks, Postgres will take advantage of almost all this RAM for its cache. Learn more about how this works <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/understanding-postgres-data-caching">in this article</a></p>

<p>Postgres constantly manages the cache of your data: rows you’ve written, indexes you’ve made, and metadata Postgres keeps. When the data needed for a query is entirely in that cache, performance is very fast. Queries made from cached data are often 100-1000x faster than from the full data set.</p>
<p class="note">Well engineered, high performance web applications will have 99% or more of their queries be served from cache.</p>
<p>Conversely, having to fall back to disk is at least an order of magnitude slower. Additionally, columns with large data types (e.g. large text columns) are stored out-of-line via <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/storage-toast.html">TOAST</a>, and accessing large amounts of TOASTed data can be slow.</p>

<h3 id="general-guidelines">General guidelines</h3>

<p>Access patterns vary greatly from application to application. Many applications only access a small, recently-changed portion of their overall data. Postgres can always keep that portion in cache as time goes on, and as a result these applications can perform well on smaller plans.</p>

<p>Other applications which frequently access all of their data don’t have that luxury and can see dramatic increases in performance by ensuring that their entire dataset fits in memory. To determine the total size of your dataset use the <code>heroku pg:info</code> command and look for the <code>Data Size</code> row:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pg:info
=== HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_CHARCOAL_URL (DATABASE_URL)
Plan:        Crane
Status:      available
Data Size:   9.4 MB
...</code></pre>

<p>Though a crude measure, choosing a plan that has at least as much in-memory cache available as the size of your total dataset will ensure high cache ratios. However, you will eventually reach the point where you have more data than the largest plan, and you will have to shard. Plan ahead for sharding: it takes a long time to execute a sharding strategy.</p>

<h3 id="determining-required-cache-size">Determining required cache-size</h3>

<p>There is no substitute for observing the database demands of your application with live traffic to determine the appropriate cache-size. Cache hit ratio should be in the 99%+ range. Uncommon queries should be less than 100ms and common ones less than 10ms.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/10/01/understanding-postgres-performance/">This blog post</a> includes a deeper discussion of Postgres performance concerns and techniques.</p>
</div>
<p>To measure the cache hit ratio for tables:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    'cache hit rate' AS name,
     sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) AS ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;</code></pre>

<p>or the cache hit ratio for indexes:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    'index hit rate' AS name,
    (sum(idx_blks_hit)) / sum(idx_blks_hit + idx_blks_read) AS ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_indexes</code></pre>
<div class="callout">
<p>You can also install the <a href="http://www.github.com/heroku/heroku-pg-extras">pg extras plugin</a> and then simply run heroku pg:cache_hit.</p>
</div>
<p>Both queries should indicate a <code>ratio</code> near <code>0.99</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">heap_read | heap_hit |         ratio          
-----------+----------+------------------------
       171 |   503551 | 0.99966041175571094090</code></pre>

<p>When the cache hit ratio begins to decrease, upgrading your database will generally put it back in the green. The best way is to use the <a href="/articles/fast-database-changeovers">fast-changeover technique</a> to move between plans, watch <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic">New Relic</a>, and see what works best for your application’s access patterns.</p>

<h2 id="stand-alone-vs-add-on-provisioning">Stand-alone vs. add-on provisioning</h2>

<p>Heroku Postgres can be provisioned as a <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/">stand-alone service</a> or attached to an application on Heroku <a href="/articles/heroku-postgresql">as an add-on</a>. Though the same plans are available across both services and the underlying technology and management infrastructure is the same there are some key differences.</p>

<p>When you provision a database from <a href="http://postgres.heroku.com">postgres.heroku.com</a>, you do not have direct CLI access for database administration. Administration of these databases is only supported through the web interface.</p>

<p>Many features will first be accessible via the heroku CLI for add-on databases and may not manifest in the web UI until much later. Such examples include <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/7/17/rotate_database_credentials_on_heroku_postgres_/">automatic credential rotation</a> and <a href="/articles/heroku-postgresql#pg-reset">pg:reset</a>.</p>

<p>Heroku Postgres databases created with the <code>heroku addons:add</code> command are provisioned as add-ons and are tied to a specific application on Heroku. Though they are listed and available for management in the Heroku Postgres web UI their management features can also be accessed via the heroku CLI. They retain all the features of the stand-alone service and include features only accessible via the CLI.</p>

<p>If you are interested in CLI administration, you should create the database via the CLI, even if you intend to principally access it via <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/">postgres.heroku.com</a>.</p>
<p class="note">Applications on Heroku requiring a SQL database should <a href="/articles/heroku-postgresql">provision Heroku Postgres as an add-on</a> with the <code>heroku
addons:add heroku-postgresql</code> command.</p>
