<p>You can transfer applications between Heroku accounts at any time via the <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">Heroku Dashboard</a>. Billing responsibility will transfer to the new owner as of the time of accepting the transfer and the original owner will be responsible for pro-rated usage up until that point. After the transfer is complete, the original owner will now be a collaborator on the app.</p>

<h2 id="initiate-transfer">Initiate transfer</h2>

<p>The current application owner must initiate the transfer request. To initiate the transfer the owner can navigate to the application’s settings page in the dashboard. It looks like this:</p>

<p>As the current owner you can initiate the transfer request by selecting a collaborator to transfer the app to.</p>

<h2 id="accept-transfer">Accept transfer</h2>

<p>The new owner can receive the transfer by accepting the pending transfer request at the top of the dashboard, once it’s initiated:</p>

<p>As the new owner you will have the option to accept or decline all transfer requests. If the app has an ongoing cost, such as paid add-ons or dynos, then you will be asked to enter in a credit card before accepting, if you haven’t done so already.</p>

<h2 id="cancel-transfer">Cancel transfer</h2>

<p>The owner can cancel the transfer request at anytime before the new owner accepts or declines the request.</p>
