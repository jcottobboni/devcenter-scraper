<p>Some apps on Heroku may be automatically archived.</p>

<p>When archived, an app won’t be accessible via any web domain.  In particular, accessing the app on its <code>.herokuapp.com</code> domain will yield a “No such app” response.</p>

<p>Currently apps are archived only if they have never had a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git">user-initiated deploy</a>, i.e. they are empty apps or apps created from templates and never changed.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command">Heroku CLI</a> to determine whether an app has been archived:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku apps:info -a example-app
=== example-app
Archived At:   2013-07-24 01:10 UTC
...
</code></pre>

<p>You can also inspect archived state in <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/">Heroku Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Apps can be un-archived by deploying any change to the application. See the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart">getting started guide</a> for details.</p>
