<p>Rails applications running on the Heroku Cedar stack can have the asset pipeline compiled locally, at deploy-time, or at run time. For new users, we recommend reading <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails3">Getting Started with Rails 3.x on Heroku</a> before proceeding further.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Heroku recommends <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-amazon-cloudfront-cdn#adding-cloudfront-to-rails">using the asset pipeline with a CDN</a> to increase end user experience and decrease load on your Heroku app. If you have questions about Ruby on Heroku, consider discussing it in the <a href="https://discussion.heroku.com/category/ruby">Ruby on Heroku forums</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-rails-4-asset-pipeline">The Rails 4 Asset Pipeline</h2>

<p>If you are using Rails 4 and the asset pipeline it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the document below. Much of the behavior between Rails 3 and Rails 4 is similar. Once finished please read the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails-4-asset-pipeline">Rails 4 Asset Pipeline on Heroku</a> which covers the differences between the two experiences.</p>

<h2 id="the-rails-3-asset-pipeline">The Rails 3 Asset Pipeline</h2>

<p>The Rails 3 asset pipeline is supported on Heroku’s Cedar stack. The new pipeline makes assets a first class citizen in the Rails stack. By default, Rails uses <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> for JavaScript and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> for CSS. DHH has a great introduction during his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdCI2HhfAU">keynote for RailsConf</a>.</p>

<p>The Rails asset pipeline provides an <code>assets:precompile</code> rake task to allow assets to be compiled and cached up front rather than compiled every time the app boots.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can use the asset pipeline on Heroku.</p>

<ol>
<li>Compiling assets locally.</li>
<li>Compiling assets during slug compilation.</li>
</ol><h3 id="compiling-assets-locally">Compiling assets locally</h3>

<div class="callout">
<p>If a <code>public/assets/manifest.yml</code> is detected in your app, Heroku will assume you are handling asset compilation yourself and will not attempt to compile your assets. In Rails 4 the there should be a <code>public/assets/manifest-&lt;md5 hash&gt;.json</code> instead. On both versions you can generate this file by running <code>$ rake assets:precompile</code> locally and checking the resultant files into Git.</p>
</div>

<p>To compile your assets locally, run the <code>assets:precompile</code> task locally on your app. Make sure to use the <code>production</code> environment so that the production version of your assets are generated.</p>

<pre><code class="term">RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>public/assets</code> directory will be created. Inside this directory you’ll find a <code>manifest.yml</code> which includes the md5sums of the compiled assets in Rails 3. In Rails 4 the file will be  <code>manifest-&lt;md5 hash&gt;.json</code>. Adding <code>public/assets</code> to your git repository will make it available to Heroku.</p>

<pre><code class="term">git add public/assets
git commit -m "vendor compiled assets"
</code></pre>

<p>Now when pushing, the output should show that your locally compiled assets were detected:</p>

<pre><code class="term">-----&gt; Preparing Rails asset pipeline
       Detected manifest.yml, assuming assets were compiled locally
</code></pre>

<h3 id="compiling-assets-during-slug-compilation">Compiling assets during slug compilation</h3>

<p>If you have not compiled assets locally, we will attempt to run the <code>assets:precompile</code> task during slug compilation. Your push output will show:</p>

<pre><code class="term">-----&gt; Preparing Rails asset pipeline
       Running: rake assets:precompile
</code></pre>

<p>Please see the Troubleshooting section below on explanations of how the rake task works during our slug compilation process.</p>

<h3 id="failed-assets-precompile">Failed assets:precompile</h3>

<p>If the <code>assets:precompile</code> task fails, the output will be displayed and the build will exit.</p>

<h2 id="asset-caching">Asset caching</h2>

<p>Caching of static assets can be implemented in-application using the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack-cache-memcached-rails31">Rack::Cache</a> middleware or in a more distributed fashion with a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-amazon-cloudfront-cdn">CDN</a>. Serving assets from your application does require dyno-resources so please consider an appropriate asset caching strategy for your needs.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3 id="failures-in-the-assets-precompile-task">Failures in the assets:precompile task</h3>

<p>In Rails 3.x, you can prevent initializing your application and connecting to the database by ensuring that the following line is in your <code>config/application.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="term">config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
</code></pre>

<p>Do not forget to commit to git after changing this setting.</p>

<p>In Rails 4.x this option has been removed and is no longer needed.</p>

<p>When deploying if you see something similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code class="term">could not connect to server: Connection refused
Is the server running on host "127.0.0.1" and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port xxxx?
</code></pre>

<p>This means that your app is attempting to connect to the database as part of <code>rake assets:precompile</code>. Because your database may not be available, the command may fail. You should be able to see the same error by running this command:</p>

<pre><code>env -i GEM_PATH=$GEM_PATH \
       PATH=$PATH \
       RAILS_ENV=$RAILS_ENV\
       DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1/does_not_exist_dbname \
       /bin/sh -c 'bundle exec rake --trace  assets:precompile'
</code></pre>

<p>The above command uses <code>env -i</code> which runs everything following it without any environment variables. We then manually pass in <code>GEM_PATH</code>, <code>PATH</code> and a nonexistent <code>DATABASE_URL</code>. Finally we run the command using <code>bin/sh -c</code> this tells our shell to execute <code>bundle exec rake --trace assets:precompile</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> If you are using another database you will need to replace <code>postgres</code> with the database adapter you are using as detected from your <code>Gemfile</code></p>

<p>If <code>rake assets:precompile</code> is still not working, you can debug this locally by configuring a nonexistent database in your local <code>config/database.yml</code> and attempting to run <code>rake assets:precompile</code>. Ideally you should be able to run this command without connecting to the database.</p>

<h3 id="therubyracer">therubyracer</h3>

<p>If you were previously using <code>therubyracer</code> or <code>therubyracer-heroku</code>, these gems are no longer required and strongly discouraged as these gems use a very large amount of memory.</p>

<p>A version of Node is installed by the Ruby buildpack that will be used to compile your assets.</p>

<h3 id="updating-path">Updating PATH</h3>

<p>If you need to compile assets at runtime, you must add <code>bin</code> to your PATH to access the JavaScript runtime. Check your current configuration using <code>heroku config</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku config
PATH =&gt; vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
</code></pre>

<p>If your PATH variable does not include <code>bin</code> on its own, update it by running:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku config:set PATH=bin:vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
Adding config vars:
  PATH =&gt; vendor/bundle/ru...usr/bin:/bin:bin
Restarting app... done, v7.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="no-debug-output-at-all">No debug output at all</h2>

<p>If you see no debug output and your <code>asset:precompile</code> task is not run, ensure that <code>rake</code> is in your <code>Gemfile</code> and properly committed.</p>
