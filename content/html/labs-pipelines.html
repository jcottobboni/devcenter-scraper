<p>This <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/labs">Heroku Labs</a> feature adds support for managing application releases as part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">continuous delivery workflow</a>.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>Features added through Heroku Labs are experimental and subject to change.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="multi-environment-complexity">Multi-environment complexity</h2>

<p>Maintaining <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/multiple-environments">multiple environments</a>, such as staging and production, is simple on Heroku. However, maintaining consistent deployments between these environments requires app owners to manually manage the deployment workflow. Issues that can arise from a manual deployment workflow typically include pushing the wrong commit, releasing untested code, or pushing to the incorrect environment.</p>

<h2 id="deployment-with-pipelines">Deployment with pipelines</h2>

<p>Pipelines allow you to define how your code should be promoted from one environment to the next. For example, you can push code to <code>staging</code>, have it built into a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler">slug</a> and later promote the <code>staging</code> slug to <code>production</code>. Common examples of pipelines include:</p>

<p>A simple staging to production pipeline:</p>

<pre><code>myapp-staging ---&gt; myapp
</code></pre>

<p>Or, a team’s more complex pipeline:</p>

<pre><code>myapp-jim-dev ---
                  \
                    ---&gt; myapp-staging ---&gt; myapp
                  /
myapp-kim-dev ---
</code></pre>

<div class="note">
<p>In pipeline vocabulary, “downstream” refers to the next target app in a pipeline. For example, given a <code>dev ---&gt; staging ---&gt; production</code> pipeline, staging is downstream of dev, and production is downstream of staging.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you’ve defined a pipeline, you and your team no longer have to worry about the next app to deploy to. Instead, <code>heroku pipeline:promote</code> will copy your app’s build artifact (i.e. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler">slug</a>) to the downstream app as a new release.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>Pipelines only manage the application slug. The <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git">Git repo</a>, <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars">config vars</a>, <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/managing-add-ons">add-ons</a> and other environmental dependencies are not considered part of a pipeline and must be managed independently. You can use <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/fork-app">Heroku Fork</a> to quickly clone production apps to be used for dev and staging.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="enable-pipelines">Enable pipelines</h2>

<p>To use pipelines, enable the labs feature:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku labs:enable pipelines
Enabling pipelines for you@yourcompany.com... done
WARNING: This feature is experimental and may change or be removed without notice.
For more information see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-pipelines-to-deploy-between-applications
</code></pre>

<p>And install the Heroku CLI plugin:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku plugins:install git://github.com/heroku/heroku-pipeline.git
</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-pipelines">Using pipelines</h2>

<p><code>heroku pipeline:add</code> adds a downstream app to your current app. Specify the name of your downstream app when creating the pipeline.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pipeline:add myapp
Added downstream app: myapp
</code></pre>

<p>You can show the downstream app for your current app with <code>heroku pipeline</code>. For example, <code>myapp-staging</code> has a downstream of <code>myapp</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pipeline
Pipeline: myapp-staging ---&gt; myapp
</code></pre>

<p>You can also diff against the downstream app with <code>heroku pipeline:diff</code>. The results show a comparison of releases between the upstream and downstream apps.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pipeline:diff
Comparing myapp-staging to myapp...done, myapp-staging ahead by 1 commit:
73ab415  2012-01-01  A super important fix  (Jim)
</code></pre>

<p>Promote an app using <code>heroku pipeline:promote</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pipeline:promote
Promoting myapp-staging to myapp...done, v2
</code></pre>

<h2 id="staging-to-production-workflow">Staging to production workflow</h2>

<p>The most typical workflow involves deploying to staging, verifying functionality and performing some form of user acceptance testing, and then promoting to production.</p>

<p>First, use <code>git push</code> to deploy your code to the staging app.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ git push heroku master
...
</code></pre>

<p>Once the staging app is ready to be promoted, it’s a good practice to compare against its downstream. Use <code>heroku pipeline:diff</code> to see the differences:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pipeline:diff
Comparing myapp-staging to myapp...done, myapp-staging ahead by 2 commits:
82af415  2012-01-02  A super important fix  (Jim)
90dc189 2012-01-02  A super awesome feature (Kim)
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we know what we’re promoting, use <code>heroku pipeline:promote</code> to promote the release from staging to production (the downstream app).</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku pipeline:promote
Promoting myapp-staging to myapp...done, v2
</code></pre>

<p>Pipeline promotion results in a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases">release-entry</a> on the downstream app.</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku releases --app myapp

=== myapp Releases
v2  Promote myapp-staging v6 0f0a53b  you@yourcompany.com   1m ago
...
</code></pre>

<div class="note">
<p>Revert a promotion as you do other errant operations by invoking <code>heroku rollback</code> on the downstream app.</p>
