<p>This article applies to apps on the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bamboo">Bamboo</a> stack.  For the most recent stack, <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar">Cedar</a>, see <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/delayed-job">Delayed Job</a>.</p>

<p>Delayed Job, also known as DJ, is a queueing system for Rails.    Please reference the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/delayed-job">Delayed Job</a> documentation on Dev Center to learn how to configure Delayed Job, enqueue jobs, and build workers.</p>

<h2 id="running-workers">Running Workers</h2>

<p>These instructions apply to the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bamboo">Bamboo</a> stack only.</p>

<p>Once your app uses DJ, you can start workers locally, or on a traditional host,
using <code>rake jobs:work</code>.  On Heroku’s Bamboo stack, start your worker process via the <code>heroku
workers</code> command:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ cd myapp
$ heroku scale workers=1
myapp is now running 1 worker
</code></pre>

<p>You can verify that the DJ process started without error by inspecting the
logs:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku logs
2011-05-31T15:58:43+00:00 app[dj.1]: (in /app)
2011-05-31T15:58:43+00:00 app[dj.1]: *** Starting job worker host:runtime.51985 pid:2476
</code></pre>

<h2 id="managing-workers">Managing Workers</h2>

<div class="callout">
<p>To shut down all worker processes, set workers to zero: <code>heroku scale workers=0</code></p>
</div>

<p>Heroku will run and manage the number of worker processes you specify, and
you’ll be billed to a prorated second, exactly like dynos.  You can increase or decrease
your workers as needed:</p>

<pre><code class="term">$ heroku scale workers=3
myapp is now running 3 workers
$ heroku scale workers=2
myapp is now running 2 workers
</code></pre>
