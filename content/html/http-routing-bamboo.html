<div class="warning">
<p>This article applies to apps using the deprecated Bamboo routing stack. You need to <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/moving-to-the-current-routing-stack">migrate your app’s routing to the current routing stack</a> by September 22, 2014.</p>
</div>

<p>The Heroku platform automatically routes HTTP requests sent to your app’s hostname(s) through to all of your web dynos.</p>

<p>Applications running on the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bamboo">Bamboo</a> stack use the <code>heroku.com</code> HTTP stack. Apps on the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar">Cedar</a> stack use the newer <code>herokuapp.com</code> HTTP stack, which offers <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing">more direct routing</a> to your dyno to allow more advanced uses of HTTP.</p>

<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bamboo">Bamboo</a> apps use the heroku.com stack.  Any request sent to <code>*.heroku.com</code> is using the <code>heroku.com</code> stack.  The new <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar">Cedar</a> stack uses <code>*.herokuapp.com</code>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="request-distribution">Request distribution</h3>

<p>A request sent to Bamboo app <code>myapp.heroku.com</code> passes through an <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> proxy, into a Heroku router, and finally to one of the app’s dynos, chosen at random.</p>

<h3 id="request-queueing">Request queueing</h3>

<p>Each router node maintains an internal per-app request queue. For Bamboo apps, router nodes limit the number of active requests per dyno to 1 and queue additional requests. There is no coordination between routing nodes however, so this request limit is per routing node. The request queue on each router has a maximum backlog size of 50n (n = the number of web dynos your app has running). If the request queue on a particular router fills up, subsequent requests to that router will immediately return an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#h11-backlog-too-deep">H11 (Backlog too deep)</a> response.</p>

<h3 id="request-body-size-limit">Request body size limit</h3>

<p>The <code>heroku.com</code> stack has a 30 megabyte request body size limit.</p>

<h3 id="30-second-timeout">30 second timeout</h3>

<p>All requests on the <code>heroku.com</code> stack are limited to 30 seconds total time. Any request that takes more than 30 seconds will be <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/request-timeout">returned to the user as an error page</a>. This 30-second limit is measured by the router processing the request, and includes all time spent in the dyno, including the kernel’s incoming connection queue and the app itself.</p>

<h3 id="http-1-0">HTTP 1.0</h3>

<p>The <code>heroku.com</code> stack is HTTP 1.0 compliant only.  HTTP 1.1 features such as long-polling and chunked response are not supported.</p>
