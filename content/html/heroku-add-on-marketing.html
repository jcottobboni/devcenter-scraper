<p>After your add-on has progressed through <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stages-of-add-on-development">alpha, beta and GA</a>, your add-on will be made available to customers, and marketed by Heroku to drive customers to use it.   This article looks at the marketing opportunities around an add-on.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-provide">What we provide</h2>

<p>We feature new add-ons once they’re initially launched as GA. New GA add-ons will be featured in two places:</p>

<ol>
<li>A write-up in our monthly newsletter describing your add-on. You can work with us to help craft text for this highlight.</li>
<li>In the carousel at the top of the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com">add-ons marketplace</a>.</li>
</ol><p>Featured add-ons are also highlighted within the carousel. These add-ons are selected based on the overall product quality as well as uptime/response time.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-do-not-provide">What we do not provide</h2>

<p>While in the future this list is subject to change at this time we do not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do joint press releases.</li>
<li>Run marketing campaigns explicitly for add-ons.</li>
<li>Email customers directly in relation only to add-on updates/releases.</li>
</ul><h2 id="general-guidance">General guidance</h2>

<p>Beyond what we directly provide and don’t provide we’ve found that some things do work well. Here’s a few items that we have found to be effective:</p>

<ol>
<li>Thorough <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/documenting-an-add-on">documentation</a> on how to use the add-on for all supported languages.</li>
<li>Technical content, both directly on how to use your product as well as broader technical content, that developers would find interesting.</li>
<li>A clear product page and add-ons marketplace listing that clearly describes what problem your product is solving and details of the product.</li>
<li>Monitoring social streams for people talking about your product and engaging with them there.</li>
</ol><h2 id="press-releases">Press releases</h2>

<p>Heroku currently does not participate in add-on press releases. However, we are happy to help promote your press releases and news via our social channels. Please notify Heroku of any press releases 2 weeks in advance to help maximize your marketing efforts.</p>
